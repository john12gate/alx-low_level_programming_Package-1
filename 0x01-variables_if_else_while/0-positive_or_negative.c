 *  The variable n will store a different value every time you will run this program
 *  You donâ€™t have to understand what rand, srand, RAND_MAX do. Please do not touch this code
 *  The output of the program should be:
 *  The number, followed by:

 *  	if the number is 0: is zero
 *  	if the number is less than 0: is negative
 *  followed by a new line
